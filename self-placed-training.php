                                <p class="detail__infor__sub">It is generally assumed that content is the most important component of any educational platform, but that’s not always the case. In today’s day and age, how (and not just what) you share can make a world of difference in the knowledge acquisition and retention of learners.</p>
                                <p class="detail__infor__sub">In the face of a constantly evolving e-Learning landscape, pacing refers to the speed at which people need or want to collect/assimilate/retain content.</p>
                                <p class="detail__infor__sub">More specifically, self-paced learning is defined learners themselves. The beauty of our intuitive learning programs is that they allow learners to attain mastery over a subject from virtually anywhere.</p>
                                <p class="detail__infor__sub">Not every learner has the same aptitude – and not every learner can acquire knowledge uniformly. As cultivators of industry-leading IT professionals who’re inspired by the mission of changing the face of tomorrow, we create empowering programs that uncover the hidden champion in every single candidate.</p>
                                <p class="detail__infor__sub">Our results-driven approach helps us develop, deliver and upgrade all kinds of e-learning courses – encompassing all technologies leveraged in real-world environments.</p>
