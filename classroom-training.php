                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub">With the emergence of new learning formats that promise to the change the face of IT training forever, classroom training needs to evolve in order to stay relevant in a competitive and dynamic ecosystem. Harnessing the evergreen potential of classroom training requires training providers to amplify learning outcomes by sharpening the edge of a face-to-face interaction – which is exactly where we step in and make the learning count.</p>
                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub">As passionate visionaries and problem solvers, we’re driven by our motivation to leverage the unique ability of classroom training to create a great space for constructive dialogue between the trainer and the trainee – that allows participants to gain guidance in a timely manner, learn how to solve complex on-the-job problems, understand the tips of the trade and join an ever-expanding, lifelong collaborative network of fellow participants.

                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub"><span class="bold">Dismantling Silos:</span> Getting people from varying backgrounds and learning abilities in a classroom helps break down silos that inhibit functional dialogue and cooperation</p>
                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub"><span class="bold">Guarantee of Completion:</span> Unlike other forms of on-demand learning that can be picked-up and put down repeatedly and potentially never reaching completion, the probability of candidates completing their learning objectives – that too in a time bound manner – is almost always guaranteed.</p>
                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub"><span class="bold">Faster Problem Solving:</span> The beauty about our classroom training is that it is interactive and builds a project-based learners’ group that facilitates and accelerates problem solving.</p>
                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub"><span class="bold">Productive Environment:</span> Students with similar professional interests can follow structured learning and benefit from the experience and knowledge shared by others.</p>
                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub"><span class="bold">Better Focus:</span> Employees attending an instructor-led classroom training are able to focus to ‘live training’ better because they have fewer distractions and are more accountable to what is being taught.</p>

                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub"><span class="bold">Adaptability:</span> Instructors can adapt the training modules to address the specific needs – or one particular problem area of individual participants in the classroom, where some of them may get stuck.</p>
                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub"><span class="bold">Individual Attention:</span> Classroom training allows instructors to observe subtle signs among individual learners – such as body language – and proactively offer help during breaks or after-hours, something which is not feasible in remote learning.</p>
                                    <p class="detail__infor__sub"><span class="bold">Better RoI:</span> A win-win situation for both parties because you get exactly what you pay for, and obtain better results in a condensed manner as compared to self-study, where it is common for learners to begin and stop training, thus causing lower retention </p>
